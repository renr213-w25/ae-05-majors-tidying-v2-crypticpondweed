title: "AE 05: Tidying StatSci Majors"
---

## Goal

Our ultimate goal in this application exercise is to make the following data visualization.

![](images/statsci-plot.png){fig-alt="Line plot of numbers of Statistical Science majors over the years (2011 - 2021). Degree types represented are BS, BS2, AB, AB2. There is an increasing trend in BS degrees and somewhat steady trend in AB degrees." fig-align="center"}

## Data

The data come from Duke's Office of the University Registrar. The data were downloaded from Duke as a PDF file. The data have been exported to a CSV file for you. Let's load that in.

```{r}
#| label: load-packages-data
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)

statsci <- read_csv("data/statsci.csv")
```

And let's take a look at the data.

```{r}
statsci
```

## Pivoting

-   **Demo:** Pivot the `statsci` data frame *longer* such that each row represents a degree type / year combination and `year` and `n`umber of graduates for that year are columns in the data frame.

```{r}
#| label: pivot

statsci |> 
  pivot_longer(
    cols=-degree,
    names_to = "year",
    values_to = "n"
  )
  
  
```

-   **Question:** What is the type of the `year` variable? Why? What should it be?

*The year variable is a character, and it should be numeric. It has retained the type of variable from the coloumns of the table we started with.*

-   **Demo:** Start over with pivoting, and this time also make sure `year` is a numerical variable in the resulting data frame.

```{r}
#| label: pivot-with-transform

statsci |> 
  pivot_longer(
    cols=-degree,
    names_to = "year",
    names_transform = as.numeric,
    values_to = "n"
  )
```

-   **Question:** What does an `NA` mean in this context? *Hint:* The data come from the university registrar, and they have records on every single graduates, there shouldn't be anything "unknown" to them about who graduated when.

*The NAs mean no one graduated, so they should be 0's*

-   **Demo:** Add on to your pipeline that you started with pivoting and convert `NA`s in `n` to `0`s.

```{r}

#| label: convert-na

statsci |> 
  pivot_longer(
    cols=-degree,
    names_to = "year",
    names_transform = as.numeric,
    values_to = "n"
  ) |>
  mutate(n=if_else(is.na(n),0,n))
```

-   **Demo:** In our plot the degree types are BS, BS2, AB, and AB2. This information is in our dataset, in the `degree` column, but this column also has additional characters we don't need. Create a new column called `degree_type` with levels BS, BS2, AB, and AB2 (in this order) based on `degree`. Do this by adding on to your pipeline from earlier.

```{r}
#| label: degree-type

statsci_new <- statsci |>  
  pivot_longer(  
    cols = -degree,  
    names_to = "year",  
    names_transform = as.numeric,  
    values_to = "n"  
  ) |>  
  mutate(n = if_else(is.na(n), 0, n)) |>  
  separate_wider_delim(degree, delim = "(", names = c("major", "degree_type")) |>  
  mutate(  
    degree_type = str_remove(degree_type, "\\)"),  
    degree_type = fct_relevel(degree_type, "BS", "BS2", "AB", "AB2")  
  )  

  
  
```

-   **Your turn:** Now we start making our plot, but let's not get too fancy right away. Create the following plot, which will serve as the "first draft" on the way to our [Goal]. Do this by adding on to your pipeline from earlier.

![](images/statsci-plot-draft.png){fig-alt="Line plot of numbers of Statistical Science majors over the years (2011 - 2021). Degree types represented are BS, BS2, AB, AB2. There is an increasing trend in BS degrees and somewhat steady trend in AB degrees." fig-align="center"}

```{r}
#| label: plot-draft

ggplot(statsci_new, aes(x=year, y=n, colour=degree_type))+
         geom_line() + 
         geom_point()
       )

```

-   **Your turn:** What aspects of the plot need to be updated to go from the draft you created above to the [Goal] plot at the beginning of this application exercise.

*line colours, theme, legend position and border, axis titles and legend title, add title and subtitle, and add caption, scale of years (x)*

-   **Demo:** Update x-axis scale such that the years displayed go from 2011 to 2023 in increments of 2 years. Do this by adding on to your pipeline from earlier.

```{r}
#| label: plot-improve-1-3

ggplot(statsci_new, aes(x=year, y=n, colour=degree_type))+
         geom_line() + 
         geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2011, 2023, by = 2)) +
  scale_color_manual(
    values = c(
      "BS" = "cadetblue4",
      "BS2" = "cadetblue3",  
      "AB" = "lightgoldenrod4",
      "AB2" = "lightgoldenrod3"
    ))+
  labs(x="Number of majors graduating",
       y="Graduation year",
       colour="Degree type",
       title="Statistical Science majors over the years",
       subtitle = "Academic years 2011-2023",
       caption = "Source: Office of the University Registrar\nhttps://registrar.duke.edu/registration/enrollment-statistics"
)+
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
    legend.title = element_text(size = 12),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 10),
    plot.caption = element_text(size = 10)
  )+
  theme_minimal()

```

-   **Demo:** Update line colors using the following level / color assignments. Once again, do this by adding on to your pipeline from earlier.
    -   "BS" = "cadetblue4"

    -   "BS2" = "cadetblue3"

    -   "AB" = "lightgoldenrod4"

    -   "AB2" = "lightgoldenrod3"

```{r}
#| label: plot-improve-2

# add your code here
```

-   **Your turn:** Update the plot labels (`title`, `subtitle`, `x`, `y`, and `caption`) and use `theme_minimal()`. Once again, do this by adding on to your pipeline from earlier.

```{r}
#| label: plot-improve-3

# add your code here
```

-   **Demo:** Finally, adding to your pipeline you've developed so far, move the legend into the plot, make its background white, and its border gray. Set `fig-width: 7` and `fig-height: 5` for your plot in the chunk options.

```{r fig-width=7, fig-height=5}
#| label: plot-improve-4

ggplot(statsci_new, aes(x=year, y=n, colour=degree_type))+
         geom_line() + 
         geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2011, 2023, by = 2)) +
  scale_color_manual(
    values = c(
      "BS" = "cadetblue4",
      "BS2" = "cadetblue3",  
      "AB" = "lightgoldenrod4",
      "AB2" = "lightgoldenrod3"
    ))+
  labs(x="Number of majors graduating",
       y="Graduation year",
       colour="Degree type",
       title="Statistical Science majors over the years",
       subtitle = "Academic years 2011-2023",
       caption = "Source: Office of the University Registrar\nhttps://registrar.duke.edu/registration/enrollment-statistics"
)+
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(
    legend.position = c(0.2,0.8),
    legend.background = element_rect(fill = "white", color = "gray") 
  )
  
```
